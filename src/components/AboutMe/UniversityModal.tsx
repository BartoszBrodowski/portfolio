                    <p> 
                        I'm a <strong>3rd year Computer Science</strong> student at University of GdaÅ„sk.

                        I was also fascinated by the idea of <strong>creating</strong> something from scratch and seeing it come to life but I never could draw, paint etc. Math was always something that was coming easy to me, so I thought that Computer Science would be a good choice for me.

                    <p>
                        I was right. I'm really enjoying my studies and I'm keen on <strong>learning new thigns</strong>. My favorite field of IT is <strong>Web Development</strong> and I'd want to forward my career in this direction.
